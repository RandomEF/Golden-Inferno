After leaving the cave of statues, the trio made their way out of the village and continued in their original direction with Winston still bugging Zenon. 

“Say it again.”

“Swing batter batter?” Zenon said somewhat exasperated and confused.

“I swear you’re doing this on purpose!”

“No, I am literally saying what I said earlier.” He sighed.

“Can you two can it?” Bianca asked, “It’s not that important. Plus we are finally near the ravine.” She pointed towards a massive towering wall in front of them that grasped at the heavens. A massive corridor was visible in the middle, and it was quite literally the only way to go. Even though the group were off-centre through their detours, they were still in front of the corridor. It sort of acted as the proper split between the South and North, there was no going around or over the Ravine. Just straight through. “I’m guessing the things in there will be worse than the things we already faced,” Bianca murmured.

“But we’re ready, right?” Winston reassured, “Let’s go.”

The first few minutes of the ravine were seemingly uneventful barring the feeling of being trapped within towering walls. Eventually, they were confronted by what seemed to be red wolves who were somewhat larger than normal. With one slash Zenon took out all of them but one who stayed behind. It howled.

“For fuck’s sake,” Winston grunted, sweating as more and more wolves rushed them. They had been constantly killing wolves for at least half an hour now and it didn’t look like it was going to stop. “We gotta get out of here.”

“You can say that again,” Bianca replied, stabbing a wolf in the head and slamming it into the ground, taking the blood-covered arrow out and launching it into another.

“We gotta clear a path and block them off,” Zenon shouted as he rushed forward with the others following behind. As they passed through an overhang, Winston would slam the wall with his hammer, causing boulders to fall behind them, crushing several wolves or the better term - Lycan. Having some breathing space, Bianca and Winston would pant, bending over slightly as Zenon walked forward, “Come on, we don’t have time.” He huffed as the others jogged after him. 

The next portion was even worse, occasionally random creatures who had adapted to survive in the dark lands had attacked them and they definitely weren’t as weak as their ‘normal’ counterparts. Covered in sweat and animal blood, they reached what seemed to be a border. A line of lava would split the Ravine between its brown dusty part and a dark, hot volcanic path. One that all the animals avoided.

“There’s no way but forward, right guys?” Winston would laugh nervously although he was basically slumped from weariness at this point.

“We’re so close to Alchante, I can feel it.” Bianca would say in reply, leading them over the small gap and into the true Ravine. The land was a chaotic mess with skeletons all over although they were yet to be greeted by any human or monster. That was until they came across a body with torn clothes across a guts-covered rock. A slimy fluid coated her hair and face and a shoe was discarded. Blood trickled out of her bottom half. Upon closer look the face was recognisable. “That’s the woman from team one,” Bianca remarked with a hand over her mouth in disgust, “Idiots for carrying on even though they lost a member of their team.” She dragged Winston away who looked like he was about to suggest something, “There’s nothing we can do, she’s dead Winston.” Just then, large grey creatures with warped horns surrounded them. Saliva dripped out of their mouths with slit eyes eagerly staring at the trio, most focussing on Bianca.

“Guess we found the culprits,” Zenon remarked, cracking his neck as he coldly looked at them. “To get to her, you’ll have to get through me.” He said, staring at the demons in front of him with malice in his eyes. Screams echoed through the ravine as Zenon sliced and diced his opponents, their flesh almost melting on contact with his blade. Bianca and Winston were preoccupied with demons of their own, killing them in interesting ways as well. One decided to charge at Zenon who leapt up and grabbed its horn, guiding it straight into another demon's eye causing blue blood to erupt all over them before using their weight to send them onto a sharp rock which impaled them. He’d then swiftly decapitate them, blood running across the floor like a river. Another tried to attack him from behind and he span, cutting across its stomach as its intestines spilt out and it would sluggishly grab them, trying to stuff them back inside before Zenon’s katana slashed into its neck, spinning the demon’s world upside-down. 

As they made their way through the Ravine, many more demons of different sizes attacked them although each fell just like the last. Eventually, they got to a place littered with weapons and suits of armour.

“Something is definitely off about this place,” Winston commented, blue blood evaporating off him as they walked. Bags were clear under all their eyes and it seemed like it would never end. This was another kind of hell. Zenon would turn around as he heard a rattle and the suits of armour rose and grabbed the nearest weapon. “Yep, I called it,” Winston muttered as he swung his hammer, smashing one of the suits into pieces although he wasn’t prepared for the next one that slashed his back. He gave out a cry and moved forward before getting elbowed in the head by a different suit. Bianca’s eyes flickered around as she fired off an arrow but it didn’t do anything and rather bounced off the suits. She took a deep breath and started aiming for the seams although her arrow rate had slowed down. Zenon saved Winston from another strike by cutting between the seam of the helmet and the chestplate of a suit that was about to deliver what would have been a finishing blow. It was clear the assassin was struggling against these and had to skillfully place his slashes. A battle horn sounded and many more suits rushed out as one coated in blue emerged from the depths, flames surrounding him. Bianca and Winston were quickly overcome by knights and eventually held down as Zenon struggled to keep knocking one after another until wham. A huge boulder dropped on him and he fell to one knee, keeping it from crushing him although he was basically immobile now. He gritted his teeth as his eyes searched around, looking at his companions who were being forcibly restrained. The blue knight would walk out, despite not having a visible face he would walk with a visible sign of pride. 

“I am Knight Percival.” He introduced himself as he walked over to the knights holding Bianca. “A Bannerat of a few of the soldiers of Hell.” The knight would say as he crouched down tilting Bianca’s head up.

“Get off her!” Winston would lunge forward yet the suits held him back as he struggled, madness in her eyes to which Percival turned to look at him. Just then Bianca spat on his hand causing him to backhand her, leaving a mark.

“My my, what animals you guys are.” He looked Winston directly in the eye as he flicked his finger at the Knights holding Bianca, instructing them to lift her up. Without breaking eye contact he’d pull on Bianca’s cheek harshly causing her to wince slightly. “Come on boy, try and stop me.” He laughed as his other hand tucked a lock of her brown hair behind her ear. Winston would look to Zenon for help although the boy’s eyes were closed as he focussed all his strength on keeping the boulder from crushing him.

“LET GO.” Winston struggled even more causing more knights to rush over and press down on him to keep him down. “MONSTERS.” He screamed as Bianca kept her composure staring Percival in the eyes.

“Creeps like you really piss me off.” She groaned slightly, rolling her eyes. “Not enough love from a woman growing up I assume?” She mocked. A resounding clang was heard as a dagger from within Bianca’s boot swung up as she kicked out. Unfortunately, it didn’t amount to much as it hit a heavily armoured part of Percival. 

“Did you really think that would stop me?” He tilted his head, mild annoyance in his voice, “Looks like you’re going to need some punishi-” he was cut off as his head flew off and Zenon’s eyes shone out from behind him. The knights holding Bianca fell to the ground in pieces as a wisp escaped from them. Multiple daggers would fly out, striking the knights holding Winston directly in the opening of their visors causing these suits to collapse as well, freeing Winston. A horn stuck out of Zenon’s head and steam escaped from his mouth as he breathed his head falling forward as he threw up. The horn reduced in size as he looked at Bianca who shivered on the ground and he held out a hand to her which she gratefully took.

“So gross.” She commented, standing up. Winston would rush over, worry in his eyes although she’d nod at him, not saying anything. Then, the ground began to shake. The air felt thick, heavy to breathe in. Like a huge weight was pressing down on them.
