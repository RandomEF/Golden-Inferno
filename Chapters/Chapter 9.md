# Chapter 9

After some more travelling the trio would reach a large luscious lake. It sparkled with the reflection of the sun, light rays dancing over the calm ripples that reverberated throughout the lake.

“This seems like the perfect place to take a rest wouldn’t you say!” Winston perked up with a small grin.

“Why are you smiling like that? It's weird.” Bianca murmured, giving him a suspicious look before shrugging, “But you’re right we might as well stop. Gotta fill up our flasks anyways.” Zenon nodded as he pulled out the large amounts of flasks they were carrying. “If you don’t mind, I have been dying for a wash.” Bianca said removing her outer layer giving Winston a stern look as she began making her way towards a tree that overhung the lake, “You better not try to peek.”

“What, I would never!” Winston retorted, blushing angrily as Bianca stuck out her tongue. “Why does she always do this?” Winston pouted once she was out of earreach, sitting down and hugging his knees to himself as his eyes travelled towards the direction she walked in but they got blocked by Zenon leaning down next to him to fill up the flasks.

“It's because she likes you and probably feels comfortable around you.” Zenon shrugged, “I guess she considers you a friend?”

“One, it would be better to fill up the flasks from deeper into the lake so you don’t get as many floating sediments. Two, does she not like you?”

“One, no you can go do that. Two, she does now.”

“Fine,” Winston said, kicking his shoes off and grabbing the flasks. “Since you’re too pussy to go near water.”

“I never said that.” Zenon frowned before stepping fully clothed into the water, “See?” He indicated snatching some of the flasks from Winston before wading in more.

“You’re a psychopath.” Winston joined him.

“I know.”

“Why are you always like constantly clothed, like not in a weird way but you always look like you’re either in the coldest part of the country or just wearing such bagger stuff no one can see anything? Why?” Winston asked as he started filling up the flasks.

“You literally know I’m an assassin, I have to limit the possibility of enemies predicting me before I carry out an action.” Zenon grinned, “I’ve got that down to a tee. My muscles don’t even twitch before I do something! I’d say I’m pretty unreadable.” He stuck out his chest with a proud look on his face and it was met with Winston giving a blank stare.

“What are you on about?” He sighed before splashing a wave of water at Zenon.

“Oi.” He splashed him back, the splashes growing in increasing amounts until they basically wrestled into the water, Zenon easily overpowering Winston as he stuck his head under, before letting him up momentarily, “Go on, beg for mercy.” Zenon teased.

“Never!” Winston retorted, closing his eyes as he got sent under once more.

“I leave you guys alone for like 10 minutes and this is what happens?” Bianca said from the lake edge as she returned in a simple sports bra with her hair sticking to one side of her body, dripping occasionally.

“Since when did you have time to pack extra stuff?” Zenon asked before glancing down realising he had held Winston under a little too long. “Oops.” He laughed slightly as Winston coughed, wiping his eyes.

“Screw you.” He shook his hair, droplets flying everywhere. It was only now he noticed Bianca’s somewhat defined build. It made him feel slightly left behind and insecure about his own, sure his muscles had come out after the absurd training Zenon put him through although they didn’t exactly compare to Bianca’s manifesting abs.

“I prepared very well thank you very much, I’m not basic to the point I have multiple versions of the same clothes.” Bianca stared at the two looking somewhat done with the both of them.

“Hey! It’s effective.” They both replied in unison.

“Whatever. Bring back the flasks unless you wanna drown each other some more.”

“Actually I was the only person getting drowned.” Winston pointed out to which Bianca would give a big smile.

“Let’s change that then!” She proposed jumping in towards Zenon.

Zenon would shake the water out of his hair by the side of the lake, completely dripping.

“See Zenon, teamwork is pretty great huh?” Winston would nudge him by the side.

“Not when it’s against me!” He gave a wry grin as he removed his shirt revealing his physique causing both Winston and Bianca’s jaws to drop in complete shock. “What?” He asked, giving them an oblivious look as he flexed his muscles slightly.

“You are insanely ripped!” Winston stated his eyes flickering between the boy’s eight pack and biceps. Weirdly enough, Winston didn’t feel the same body dysphoria he felt when looking at Bianca. It seemed he had come to terms with the fact he was surrounded by two absolute beasts. “Isn’t he?” Winston turned to Bianca excitedly and she turned away blushing.

“DON’T ASK ME, I WOULDN’T KNOW!” She replied flustered, hiding her face in her shoulder as Zenon innocently wrung out his shirt before wearing it again.

“Well, I think you look very cool, Zenon,” Winston said, patting his shoulder somewhat in awe.

“Er, thanks?” Zenon replied looking very very confused. Honestly the first few months of finally looking like this he would have been pretty pleased but now he was so used to it that he hadn’t really given it a second thought until the others pointed it out. “If you guys are ready I’d say we continue on though, Alchante isn’t too far now.”
