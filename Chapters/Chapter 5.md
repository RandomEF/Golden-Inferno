# Chapter Five

The sound of footsteps quietly bounced off the walls of the tunnel as the trio made their way although only one pair of footsteps echoed. 

“How can you guys even see anything?” Winston moaned, “It’s literally pitch black.” He huffed as he held onto Bianca’s sleeve.

“Stop whining like a little bitch.” She muttered as they continued through the tunnels, eventually getting to a point with three separate partings.

“No. Before you even say it, we are _not_ splitting up. I am sick and tired of seeing that trope everywhere and everyone getting crapped on by some stupidly overpowered opponent.” Winston scoffed, he may not be able to see but the light level from each way told him all he needed to know.

“Fine then, be like that. I guess we’re sticking together.”

“Let’s stick to the left. That way we can easily follow the wall without too many issues hopefully.” Zenon suggested. After hearing no complaints he shrugged and they went that way, eventually, they heard anvils. It no longer sounded like mining, but rather like creating. Smoke billowed their way and they followed it till they got to another parting.

“Since I chose the last one, Bianca can choose now,” Zenon muttered although he got no response. “Bianca…?” He asked, turning to look at her.

“What? Oh yes sorry. There’s a foul smell coming from the left side so let’s go to the right side for now.” She nodded enthusiastically, it looked like she was trying her best to stay awake.

“Alright then,” Zenon responded as he walked down the right side glancing back to make sure the others were still with him. It seemed the overall pace had slowed down and Bianca was moving sluggishly through. Unfortunately for them, what seemed to be a demon patrol had wandered through the tunnel. An arrow wished past him, barely missing his cheek and struck one of the demons right in the head. “Careful where you’re aiming.” He muttered as he drew his katana and moved towards one of the demons, delivering an X slash across its chest causing it to burst into pieces. He then side-stepped out of the way of an awkwardly thrown spear that landed in the belly of the remaining demon although it didn’t penetrate the whole way in. Zenon grabbed the end and slammed it in before swinging it out of the demon's side causing a cascade of blue-covered guts to flood out as it fell to the ground with a thud. Zenon returned the spear to Winston who smiled sheepishly but Zenon just frowned, “I thought you couldn’t see.”

“I guess it was just instinct?” Winston replied with a shrug before reaching out for Bianca.

“My sleeve is lower than that Winston..” She murmured half-asleep, “Perv.” Before guiding his hand to her actual sleeve instead of her breast.

“In my defence it’s dark!” He rushed embarrassed, Zenon could see his face was a deep scarlet.

“Let’s go, there’s a room at the end.” Zenon interrupted as he walked forward.

The tunnel opened up to what seemed to be a library, without any books. Shelves lined the wall and a permanent haze of dust covered the entire area. The most key feature was a desk in the centre. The boy walked over to it and picked up a blueprint that lay there. “Bianca, look at this.” He’d say turning towards her just as she fell to the ground.

“What happened?” Winston asked as Zenon walked over. 

“It looks like she fainted,” Zenon picked her up gently, wrapping her arms around his neck for better support, “We don’t have time to wake her up, Let’s keep going.” He said, pulling Winston to his sleeve before walking through the hallway at the other side of the library, a note of urgency in his voice. 

After some more walking, light could be seen at the end of the tunnel. Literally. Zenon took a deep breath preparing for what was at the end before stepping out into an enormous room. It was like a forge coupled with a scientist's laboratory. Vials of things littered the floor whilst demons around them were doing various things with Gallion. The centrepiece of the room however was a man with two hammers. One massive hammer on his anvil with a small one in his hand although he dropped this as the trio entered his room.

“Ah, guests!” He grinned, opening his arms wide with a smile. It was clear that the man before them wasn’t human, after all, two very large horns stuck out of his head. “Please do make yourself at home, I hope the journey wasn’t too much for you.” He left his workbench and walked over towards them as Zenon tensed up and Winston drew his spear. “Please, no need for theatrics.” The humanoid raised his hand and appeared directly in front of Winston putting a finger on his spear, shattering it instantly, “After all, one of your friends has already fallen ill to my poison. It’s meant to make everyone risk-takers although I guess she can’t even handle it. Pitiful. You guys don’t have long anyways.” He giggled slightly before seemingly teleporting back to his workbench, “The beauty of science!” The hairs on the back of Winston’s neck rose as he looked around. The rest of the demons seemed to continue working despite the interaction, almost as if they were scared to stop working. “Ah how rude of me, I haven’t even introduced myself yet! I am Dr Maxwell although you can call me Max if you prefer.” He gave a warm smile, “One of the Generals of Hell and the Lead Scientist.” He puffed his chest out proudly. Zenon frowned slightly as his eyes flickered around, seemingly counting the number of demons in the chamber. “Oh don’t worry boys, I won’t kill you until I’ve finished building the weapon. You’re quite safe here!” Maxwell waved before picking up his hammer and getting back to work with his weapon.

“So what’s the plan here, Zenon?” Winston whispered to the boy by his side. Zenon looked at Winston, noticing how pale he seemed.

“There are twenty-four demons. You’re in no shape to fight.” Zenon looked down at Bianca, it was only just now he noticed but she smelt like the sweet floral scent of a waterfall. She looked so comfortable and he felt a pang in his heart looking at her face, this sort of weakness was so unlike her although out of the corner of his eye, he could feel Winston’s mild judgemental stare. “We wait, I guess.”

“Ah don’t worry gentlemen! I have finished!” Maxwell brandished a Warhammer made of pure Gallion. All the other demons in the area turned to look and the noises ceased. “You can kill them now,” Maxwell said, his voice getting deeper. The demons dropped their tools and started approaching them. Zenon gave a small smile tucking a lock of Bianca’s hair behind her ear before handing her to Winston who gave a huff trying to carry her.

“This won’t take too long.” He said, shooting a look at the demon’s who paused as Zenon’s gold eyes shone with bloodlust.

“What are you waiting for? There’s twenty-four of you!” Maxwell jeered as Zenon drew his katana and the demons rushed him. 

Blood covered Zenon’s cheek as he breathed heavily, steam rising from his sword as more blood slid off there. His sweaty hair hung over his eyes and a trail of corpses lay behind him.

“You know I’m impressed, I thought you wouldn’t be able to survive that.” Maxwell effortlessly spun the Warhammer between his fingers as he started walking towards Zenon before stopping and resting on it. He seemed calm and composed even though Zenon saw something else as he stared the General directly in the eye. He was shocked, unprepared. “I have an idea, why don’t you become my slave?” He blurted out somewhat uncertainly. “Yes! That way I can keep you alive and you could work for me. What do you say?” Maxwell hummed, “Your friends could become quite interesting candidates for my future experiments. You don’t have to die here.” He smiled, almost certain that Zenon would accept his wish. He believed he had the leverage. 

“We won’t,” Zenon said as he took a step and then stopped. “We won’t.” The boy appeared behind Maxwell as the scientist's head flew off and his hand slid down the hammer, his body slumping forward, headless.

“Oh.” The head said as it disappeared into the air in particles. Zenon kicked the fading body off the hammer before sheathing his katana and picking the hammer up, handing it to Winston. 

“Your new weapon.” He stated as he took Bianca back and started walking to the other side of the chamber. “We’re done here.”
