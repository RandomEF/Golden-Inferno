# Chapter Seven

Sparks flew as the dagger and arrow tip made contact and Zenon took a step back breathing slightly, Winston still over his shoulder. 

“I was wondering how long it would take for you to attack me, Talia,” Zenon muttered as he quickly placed Winston on the ground and got into a more defensive position, eyeing Bianca before moving to the side. “Why now?” He asked grunting slightly as she leapt forward and he blocked again, this time the dagger shattered into pieces and Zenon let go of the handle in midair before grabbing Bianca’s wrist and pulling her in whilst catching the broken dagger with his other hand before holding it to her neck. 

“You know I was considering waiting you out Nico,” She grunted as she struggled to move her currently deadlocked hand, “But you just refuse to let your guard completely down. It irritates me.”

“What’s going on you guys?” Winston moaned as he rubbed his eyes, “You guys are making a lot of noise.” Zenon twisted slightly to glance at Winston.

“Don’t worry Win-” He winced as another arrow tip cut across the side of his abdomen as he slammed his elbow onto Bianca’s other hand and moved back, “You weren’t the kind to play dirty, Talia.”

“You made me into this, Nico.” She muttered, almost spitting his name.

“Look, I’m sorry. I didn’t know!”

“I don’t want fucking excuses. I want you dead.”

“Woah guys let’s just chill for a moment, yeah?” Winston interjected nervously, he looked confused and lethargic but could tell that this situation was grave.

“Shut up Winston.” They said simultaneously, Zenon clutching his side as blood slowly leaked out. 

“You know I didn’t really want that to happen.”

“Nico I swear to God,” Bianca growled as she launched towards him, Zenon’s eyes widened as the arrow approached his face, Bianca really did want to kill him.

The wind howled and the rain barraged down on a tall cloaked man who was walking up a mountain, a small child holding his hand curiously. The wind blew this man's cloak and he looked down at the small boy who clutched his hand tightly.

“Don’t worry,” The man said gently, “We’ll soon be there.” He smiled although it looked sort of forced, like he hadn’t smiled in a very long time. Eventually, a small wooden cabin came into view and a man rushed out to the two.

“Please, the mountain path is dangerous at this time of year!” He cried out to the mysterious man and boy, “Come in and wait out the storm.” This man seemed to be greying on the sides of his head yet was smartly dressed, it was odd considering how isolated the place was. The nearest village was about a 2-mile descent.

“I guess we have no choice, we would appreciate your hospitality.” The cloaked man replied quickly following their mystery helper into his house. 

“My name is Andrew,” the homeowner said as the warmth of the fire crackled across his face, revealing the deep lines etched into his forehead. “This over here is my pupil, Talia.” He beckoned to a young girl who stood quietly by the fireplace. “Her parents died when she was young. I’ve been looking after her ever since.”

“Ah, that’s kind of you, I’m Raphael.” The originally hooded man took his cloak down and gave a wide smile, “This here is my son, Nico.” He beckoned towards the white-haired child who had accompanied him, “We were just going to visit the ever-blossoming tree at the top before you invited us in.”

“Ah, well if you want, the two could go and play together seeing as they are probably similar in age. Talia rarely sees kids her own age!” Andrew suggested to which Raphael nodded. The two then disappeared around the back with Talia grabbing Nico’s hand and practically dragging him.

“Wow, what a house!” Nico said as they ran through the hallway into what seemed to be a sparring room.

“I know right; Have you ever used a sword before?” She questioned very close to his face.

“My m-dad has but he never really let me hold it. It’s too dangerous apparently.” Nico muttered, stroking his arm nervously.

“Not even a wooden one?!?” She questioned to which he shook his head before she scurried over and picked one up, handing it to him. “I’ll teach you!” She practically beamed as he held it oddly in his hands. She walked behind him and reached around grabbing his arms as his face seemed to heat up turning red slightly, funnily enough, this wasn’t an uncomfortable position for them since she was slightly taller than him. “Now you wanna place your hands like this,” She started directing him.

A week had passed and the two kids were at it next to a pond filled with huge Koi. A clacking sword was audible as a wooden sword against a wooden sword rang out across the courtyard. Nico was still yet to land a hit against Talia although it seemed he had improved rapidly across the week they had spent together. Lunging forward he came for a slash from the side which Talia leapt over to avoid before he spun the blade in his hand and swung vertically. Catching her in the midriff as Raphael came outside.

“Come on Nico, we have overstayed. Time to go!” He said somewhat urgently amid Nico’s celebration to which the two kids pouted slightly.

“I promise I’ll come visit you!” Nico held out his pinkie finger to Talia as they shook before Nico got confusingly whisked away. Halfway down the mountain, he heard a shriek and swung around to face the noise, but Raphael quickly shoved him back forward, keeping a firm grip on his body.

“Sorry, kid. We aren’t going back.”

Zenon moved to the left, disarming Bianca fluidly before moving in closer to her wrapping his arms around her in a hug.

“I’m sorry…” He whispered in slight pain as her anger turned into sadness and quiet sobs rang out as her arms fell around him, “I wasn’t told that would happen. I didn’t know that your master had a hit on him, I swear. I wanted to go back, I did.”

He breathed out, “I never intended for you to be hurt, Talia. Never.”

“You lied to me.” She cried as she buried her head in his shoulder, “You knew how to use a sword…”

“So er… You guys knew each other?” Winston asked, looking mighty confused at the whole thing that had just happened in front of him. “Also, who on EARTH are Nico and Talia?” He questioned walking behind them. 

“Nico and Talia are us, just under different names.” Bianca paused as she stroked her chin mindfully, “I guess the easiest way would be for you to think of them as our middle names. Also yeah we did know each other when we were younger, Zenon was an assassin, right?” To which he would sneeze as he removed his hand from a cloth which covered his wound which had seemed to close up. 

“Well…Yeah.” He didn’t have much to say after that. “We spent some time together, kinda surprised you remembered me after what, eight years? I was only six then.”

“I was seven and you were pretty impactful on my life so I’d say yeah, I do remember you.” To which Zenon scratched his head embarrassed.

“Actions do indeed have consequences. We gotta keep moving forward though, this nightmare of a challenge isn’t over yet.” 

“How did you forgive him so easily?” Winston questioned Bianca whilst they walked.

“He didn’t have any idea, it wasn’t his fault.” She smiled softly, “Also when he pulled me in for a hug I was going to try and kill him once more but I felt a ring around his neck.” She turned to look at Winston, a small light of childish happiness in her eyes, “I gave it to him.”
