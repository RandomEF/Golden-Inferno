# Chapter 6

“So are we not going to talk about that?” Winston asked as he rested on his newfound hammer whilst the group sat under a lone tree to allow Bianca to recover her stamina.

“Talk about what?” Zenon asked, looking across Bianca to Winston who was on the other side.

“Everything.” He muttered, “For starters, you killing that general as easily as you did. It’s not right, I thought we were minced and you took him out without any hesitation.” He paused, “How are you not already a hunter?”

“Isn’t it obvious, _he’s not like us Winston_,” Bianca said resting her head back.

“Don’t try to talk too much, it won’t be easy with your current state,” Zenon muttered, completely ignoring what she said as he looked into the distance. “You were poisoned. It’s like how miners used Canary birds to tell if a mine was safe to work in except we were the canaries. Now get some rest, don’t worry you’re safe with us around.” He looked her in the eye, giving a small smile before she closed her eyes again with a sigh. There wasn’t much for them to do at the moment except wait for her immune system to flush everything out. One thing that intrigued him though was how Winston wasn’t as affected as her.

“Watcha looking at?” Winston asked as Zenon jolted slightly, realising his gaze rested on the boy a little longer than he expected.

“My bad.” Zenon replied, rubbing his arms slightly before standing up, his appearance had changed slightly after their latest ‘obstacle’ although it was hard to say what was different. I mean visually, of course, there was clearly a sack around his shoulder which seemed to clank whenever he moved although there was something clearly different about him. “Stand up Winston,” Zenon said, almost in a commanding voice. “There’s no point just sitting around doing nothing. You’re gonna get stronger.” Zenon walked over and put a foot on Winston's hammer, sliding it over to him.

“You’re kidding, right? After all that?”

“If you’re shocked by what we’ve seen so far then only know, it’s getting worse from here. We all have to get stronger if we want to face what is out there.” Zenon pointed into the distance before looking back, “Now, swing.” He said tilting his head as Winston got up and begrudgingly picked up the hammer before trying to swing. It was a really sad attempt and had no power behind it. “Your problem is your lack of strength. Come on, we’ll train whilst we have the time.” Zenon raised an eyebrow at his unwillingness in Winston’s eyes, “I’m sure Bianca will like you more if you can hold your own against a demon.”

“Using Bianca is low, Zenon.”

“I know. Now swing.”

Bianca slowly opened her eyes with a slight surprise at how dark it was now. She noticed Zenon nor Winston were next to her, rather two silhouettes were in the distance with one doing what seemed to be tricks with a hammer whilst the other dodged the hits. Each swing had a punch behind it and Bianca felt worried for a second that the other person would be unconscious for days if a single hit landed. “Must be Zenon teasing Winston in some harsh form of training.” She murmured as she got up and her vision went black momentarily, “Note to self: Don’t get up quick after being down for some time.” She shook her head as she walked over although her eyes widened in shock as she got closer. It was Winston who swung the hammer. Sweat was dripping from his forehead, he was shirtless at the moment and his build wasn’t anything impressive but she could tell he was fit. She blushed slightly as she saw the determination behind every swing, his muscles twitching from the strain of what she could only assume to be constant, restless training.

Zenon noticed her waking up and turned to face her as Winston leapt into the air, the moon acting as his background. “ZENON!” She shouted as the hammer came swinging down. A cloud of dust erupted as the hammer landed and a wave of wind below over, covering Bianca in dust. As it settled she saw Winston on one knee, panting with a small stream of blood coming out the side of his mouth. Zenon was stood behind him completely unscathed.

“Good job Winston.” The white-haired boy grinned as Winston gave a small smile before letting go of the hammer and collapsing on his side. Bianca rushed over and noticed his hands had calluses and were bloodied.

“How long have you had him doing this?”

“The same amount of time you’ve been out.”

“And how long exactly is that?”

“Around a week.”

“What’s even in that bag?” Bianca asked as they walked with Zenon carrying Winston over one shoulder.

“Oh, this?” Zenon paused and pulled it over his neck with one hand before handing it to Bianca, “A gift for you.” She opened it to see arrow tips made out of Gallion, “Spent some time raiding the area after we were finished. Figured these would be quite useful for you.” He nodded as they continued their journey.

“Er, thanks.” She muttered, not really sure what to say before giving Zenon a light punch on the shoulder, “I guess I was really out of it huh.” Zenon gave a light nod as he focused on the path ahead.

“Did you know Winston’s been holding back all this time?” He said subtly changing the topic, “He was nowhere near his limits, all he needed was a little push I guess. He shouldn’t be holding us back anymore.” He glanced at the boy on his shoulder, to an outsider it looked quite comical as Winston had a somewhat more defined build than Zenon whose clothes seemed to hide basically everything about his body.

“That’s good. I’m still recovering but I can handle any demons we come across, hopefully, an extra pair of hands will be helpful.” She swung round and stopped in front of Zenon, getting rather close to his face, looking him in the eyes, “You haven’t rested, have you?”

“I don’t need to yet. I can go this entire month without needing to. I’ll be fine.” He swiftly walked around her, “You can never drop your guard in the darklands.”

“_You got that right_,” Bianca said coldly as she pulled out a Gallion arrow tip and rushed at Zenon from behind.
