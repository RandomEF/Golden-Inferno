# Chapter 12

Bianca sat up rubbing her eyes as she looked around her. She was in a quaint traditional room with a white cloth covering her. She didn’t feel any aches and she scratched her head wondering if everything was a dream. A very rich smell affronted her nostrils as she stood up: she was dressed in what looked to be a kimono. Pushing her sleeves up she saw that she had no scars which confused her thoroughly. She noticed she wasn’t alone in the room, Winston was next to her, his knees close to him. He was in a similar outfit and seemed to be deep in thought.

“Oh, you’re awake?” He’d say turning to look up at Bianca before blushing.

“What?”

“I never realised you look really nice.”

“What, after barely being alive?” She’d roll her eyes but struggle to hide a smile from him. The door would slide open and a man with a straw hat would enter with a wide smile.

“Ah, I’m glad to see you are awake!” He offered them two clay cups filled with water. “Congratulations on becoming official hunters!” Bianca would gratefully take the cup and drink it quickly.

“This tastes weirdly sweet.” She commented as the man raised a hand.

“Yeah, it’s ambrosia, acquired taste.” He grinned, “I love it but not as much as sake!”

“Anyways, we appreciate the help and everything but mind explaining what happened? Who are you, also, where’s Zenon?” Winston asked, looking around somewhat worrisomely, “Did he survive?” The man’s face darkened slightly as he took out a bottle from his robe and took a large gulp.

“Those are two questions which I can indeed answer. First of all, I’m Captain Archon, a key member of the Royal Hunters. You are in Alchante, or well the main citadel of Alchante. I brought you here after finding you in the Ravine with a dead titan next to you. Your friend killed it from what I can gather.” He sighed slightly, “I guess since I brought you here you basically passed your exam. It’s not been a month but reaching here definitely means you’re capable of being hunters.” He frowned slightly, “Also you’re the only team that survived. They made the exam stupidly hard this fifth year. You have been accredited as D-rank hunters congrats.” He paused, taking a great swig from his bottle. “Now about your friend, Zenon? He’s scheduled to be executed.”

“I’m sorry what?!” Bianca leapt forward as the man scratched his head nervously.

“Are you telling me you never noticed?”

“Noticed what?” Bianca pouted angrily.

“That he’s part demon. He has to be put down.” Archon raised his hands slightly, trying to plead with Bianca. “We don’t have a choice.” Bianca walked up to him somewhat fuming as Winston pulled her back.

“Woah, let’s not beat up the nice man who saved us,” Winston interjected although he looked somewhat annoyed as well.

“But they have it wrong!” Bianca continued, “Zenon isn’t like the other demons. He’s different. He’s more human than demon!”

“That’s what they all say. Do you know why demons learnt how to speak like us?” Archon began. Winston and Bianca shook their heads, “To trick us easier. We’re their prey.” He sighed. “Eventually, I’m sure you’ll come around.”

“Can we see him at least?” Winston asked, attempting to act as a mediator between Archon and the rage of Bianca. Archon nodded.

“Yeah, I can take you there now.”

Alchante seemed to be a really pretty place. The main citadel area was like perfection, a place of dreams. It looked like heaven. Literally. It was a semi-bustling hub with a large amount of activity. They were staying in a small building off the main path and they had to go towards what seemed to be the main building, a sort of castle mixed with a mansion where they entered the main gates. After a few twists and turns, they made it to a door where a guard stood. Seeing Archon, he waved them through as they continued down into what seemed to be a dungeon. Many different people and things were held there although they kept on going and going, eventually reaching a staircase that went further down. They then reached a checkpoint which they got waved through once more.

“Archon must be pretty important.” Winston nudged Bianca, “Getting straight through all this security.

“Zenon must be pretty dangerous.” She curtly replied. Eventually, they reach a barred door without a keyhole. Archon had to place his hand on it and a mark glowed before finally letting them into a huge dark room. Chains littered the room and in the centre was Zenon sitting on the ground, bound and motionless. “A bit excessive wouldn’t you say?” She said, giving Archon a pissed-off look as she walked over to Zenon.

“Wait, he might attack!” He said as she ignored him and knelt. Zenon’s eyes lit up in recognition as she placed a hand on his cheek and he smiled slightly.

“You’re still alive.” He said hoarsely, “Sorry about all this.”

“It’s fine, you’re the reason we’re still alive.” Winston would say joining him with Bianca. “Did you know about your execution?” He asked to which Zenon nodded. 

“Yeah, although they gave me so much extra security it seems. I must really be a threat.” He sighed, “There’s nothing I can do.”

“You mean we.” Bianca held his hand gripping it slightly, “We’re going to get you out of here.”

“Time’s up.” Archon would call out. “We have to go. You got what you wanted.” Bianca would pause and then give Zenon a fleeting kiss on the head.

“We’ll be back.”

“I know you will.”

“You guys are welcome to remain in this hut, newly recruited hunters get complimentary housing as an incentive for more people to become hunters.” Archon began, “Any questions and follow the stoned path on the left round to the back to find my squad’s headquarters. Once you’ve settled in we’d be more than happy to take you in.” He offered helpfully although shrank back slightly at the daggers that Bianca shot him, “Look it wasn’t my decision for this to happen to your friend. I would say one thing though, don’t try anything stupid. You may not see it yet but, everyone here is much stronger than you think. He left, his robe swaying behind him.

“You know I think he’s right, Bianca.” Winston began after he left, “We’re only D-rank hunters after going through all of that. It’s better to not mess with these people. Not whilst we don’t know what we’re up against.” Bianca rolled her eyes and sat down, somewhat defeated.

“I guess not, I guess the aim should be to get stronger to free Zenon right.” She grinned, “Fuck order. We know his true nature, he’s a human, he’s our friend and he’s definitely going to see the beauty of Alchante!”
