# Chapter 12

“My my my, I see we have a group of hunters.” A deep voice boomed across the ravine as it shook. A colossal suit of armour emerged, dragging his enormous sword behind him. “I’ve already dispatched others like you. I must confess they lasted longer than I expected, a whole 10 seconds!” He tilted his head before glancing at the disappearing blue knight. “Percival was flawed, he liked to take his time with his prey but I assure you, I won’t torture you.” He stopped, “I get to see the hope fade from your eyes around the same time I see the light fade away.” With almost no time to react, the greatsword came swinging down towards Winston who blocked with the hammer although the ground cracked under the enormous weight pressing down on him. The hammer would click and spikes shot out of the top yet they didn’t even reach the knight and instead clattered to the ground as the sword swung up and came through the slide, catching Winston off guard, but Zenon deflected it over their heads, watching the sparks burst over. An arrow soared, piercing the titan in the head, or so they thought. The crumpled arrow fell to the ground as the titan kicked up a screen of dirt, completely blinding the group. The sword cut through the screen like butter and slammed into the ground by Winston, causing tremors to vibrate throughout the Ravine and Winston was sent flying into a wall. Blood spurted out of his mouth as he lay there, knocked out for good. Bianca fired off a barrage of arrows yet none of them made contact. The titan looked down and swung as Zenon appeared in front of Bianca and deflected the sword once more. Blood squirted out of his hands as he panted and adopted another stance.

“Nico!” She said as her eyes saw a young Zenon holding a wooden sword.

“I’ll get us out of this alive.” He breathed as he dashed forward flipping over a swing from the side before skidding alongside the titan’s ankle, trying to cut through it although nothing happened and a rather loud grating was heard.

“Not going to work!” The titan laughed as it lifted its foot trying to crush Zenon who rolled out of the way. Zenon would signal Bianca and they both moved behind a rock.

“He’s monstrous. We can’t possibly defeat him.” Bianca panted, fear in her eyes.

“DUCK.” Zenon slammed her down to the ground as a slash barely missed their heads, decapitating the rock behind them. They scattered and Bianca sent off more arrows whilst Zenon held the titan’s attention. Suddenly the titan grabbed a chunk of rocks and threw them at Bianca. She disappeared from view, making no sound. No movement.

“And then there was one.”

Zenon’s heart thundered against his ribcage, as he looked up to the colossal knight he stood in front of him. His sword had no blood on it although Zenon could see loads.

“Give up. You know you aren’t going to win.” Lightning struck behind the knight as it started to rain. “You’re finished.” The titan raised his sword as Zenon raised his katana. The two swords collided and Zenon got sent flying although he spun and landed on his feet, blasting off the wall as another swing came. The boy barely grimaced as his skin was grazed and he felt the impact stun his arm although he started running evading more swings yet, he started getting sloppy and more grazes decorated his body until he was a mess of blood running down his face and arms. “Still standing?” Titan asked, taking a step towards Zenon whilst raising his blade. Lightning struck it and Zenon dived out of the way jumping as the sword struck the ground and the lightning dissipated into the earth. Zenon’s eyes opened wide as he avoided the shock yet he had to deflect another blow quickly. Residue lightning coursed through his body and he fell to the ground, blacking out momentarily. 

As he came to, the sword pierced his stomach and blood splattered everywhere as he got raised into the air, like an olive on a toothpick. Pain coursed through him. He looked over at Winston, at the rocks that covered Bianca, then down at the sword. Lightning coursed through him. 

“I know you’ve been suppressing me.” A voice whispered in his head, “Let go. Or else you’ll lose it all.”

A man in a white robe stood on the battlefield looking at the broken bodies of Zenon, Winston and Bianca. A large spear lay on his back and he had a noticeable stubble. A straw hat completed the look and he walked full of confidence.

“My my, what have they gotten themselves into.” He muttered to himself before surveying the fallen body of the titan which was slowly dissipating. A hole was in its chest.
