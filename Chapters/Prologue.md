# Prologue

Demons. Creatures not native to Earth, a disease many would say. No one truly knows their origin but what is for sure is that they grew in number and the word cohabitation never existed to them. Fights broke out, wars raged and the demons seemed to have supernatural powers and indescribable powers that could easily overcome the humans. Taking over the North of the continent their forces spread until they got to a ridge. One that divided the North and the South, it seemed like it would be no challenge for them to cross over however they never did. 100 years have passed and still, humans are no closer to figuring out what stopped the rampage of the demons. Some call it a magical barrier, divine intervention even.
They never forgot though. The world is theirs and they were going to take it back. It all started with a spark, a child who suddenly broke out into flames. This boy was named Adam and the King of the South adopted him as his own. A poster boy who seemed to be unique, different from the rest although one who could lead the path towards a weapon, a weapon that could eradicate the demons. From there, many people with powers started to appear spontaneously across the continent. As such, an organisation was formed called The Guild of Hunters. They would occasionally be deployed to the North Continent and fight demons in the name of retaking the country. It wasn’t so easy though, after all….AfTEr ALl….After all. The Demon King wasn’t alone.
