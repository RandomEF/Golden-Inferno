# Chapter 8

“So er… You guys knew each other?” Winston asked, looking mighty confused at the whole thing that had just happened in front of him. “Also, who on EARTH are Nico and Talia?” He questioned walking behind them.

“Nico and Talia are us, just under different names.” Bianca paused as she stroked her chin mindfully, “I guess the easiest way would be for you to think of them as our middle names. Also yeah we did know each other when we were younger, Zenon was an assassin, right?” To which he would sneeze as he removed his hand from a cloth which covered his wound which had seemed to close up.

“Well … yeah.” He didn’t have much to say after that. “We spent some time together, kinda surprised you remembered me after what, eight years? I was only six then.”

“I was seven and you were pretty impactful on my life so I’d say yeah, I do remember you.” To which Zenon stroked his head embarrassed.

“Actions do indeed have consequences. We gotta keep moving forward though, this nightmare of a challenge isn’t over yet.”

“How did you forgive him so easily?” Winston questioned Bianca whilst they walked.

“He didn’t have any idea, it wasn’t his fault.” She smiled softly, “Also when he pulled me in for a hug I was going to try and kill him once more but I felt a ring around his neck.” She turned to look at Winston, a small light of childish happiness in her eyes, “I gave it to him.”
