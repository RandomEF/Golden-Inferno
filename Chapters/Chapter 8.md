# Chapter 8

Zenon would spot people in the distance and halted the team.

“Over there.” He nodded, “It looks like team 1. What do you guys wanna do?” He asked, looking at both Bianca and Winston.

“We should go say hi, strength in numbers right?” Winston suggested although Bianca immediately cut in.

“No, we don’t know what they’re like. Could just be extra luggage. Look, there's only two of them. The other must have died…or-”

She jumped back just as a metal bat swung through the air. Winston would immediately open his hammer and swing, although it got blocked by a greatsword as three people suddenly became visible.

“Dammit Anthony, I thought your invisibility lasted until you turned it off.” Kimi would growl as he twirled the bat in his hand looking at Anthony who was pushing back against Winston, somewhat surprised at his strength.

“They’re stronger than we expected, screw off., Anthony would growl in a hoarse voice.

“Why even are you guys attacking us?” Zenon would ask, standing still as he remained alone. “There’s no point, we aren’t in Phase One anymore.”

“The fewer people that survive the better, we will get a higher rank that way, you kid.” Kimi snarled as he took another swing at Bianca who once again got distance. Out of nowhere, a woman would leap at Zenon although he stood still and she passed straight through him, dissipating into the air as he elbowed the area behind him and a loud crack was heard as the original woman who leapt at him materialised bent over in pain.

“Projections huh?” He looked down at her, his eyes devoid of any emotion. “You guys underestimated us.” He said as Winston broke free of the greatsword and slammed it into Anthony’s side, sending him flying. “If you leave now, we won’t kill you.”

“You guys aren’t even using magic!” Kimi hissed, “This should be light work.” He laughed running at Bianca, twirling the bat round thrice as fast as before an arrow pierced his head and he fell backwards, twitching in pain before laying still.

“What a clown,” Bianca muttered before looking at the rest of Team 1 who looked shocked. “Now you guys won’t even become hunters. Let’s put them out of misery Zenon.” She said taking a step towards Anthony before Winston stepped in between them.

“No, we’ve already won.” He pointed out before nodding towards the defeated looks of the other two, "Leave them be."

“Why do you have to be such a hero, Winston,” Bianca questioned.

“Why aren’t you guys?” He replied, a determined look in his eyes, “We’re going.”

“If that was our competition, then this challenge should be a piece of cake!” Winston hummed as Team 2 continued their journey.

“The only reason you think that is because you got stronger.” Zenon pointed out, “If they had attacked us right at the beginning, you’d be dead.”

“Also,” Bianca added, “They knew how to use magic. We don’t.” She sighed, “We are arguably strongly disadvantaged compared to them.

“Wait, neither of you guys know magic?” Winston looked shocked. “I thought you both happened to just know everything, how do we even learn magic.”

“No point.” Zenon shrugged, “We have no way to right now. Why do you think it’s called magic Winston? Most people don’t know how it works. Even those who do aren’t the best with it. We’ll be fine without it.”

“I agree with Zenon. Let’s just focus on what we have at the moment.” Bianca added. “Plus we aren’t that far from Alchante!” She tapped Winston on the shoulder, “You’ve done well so far, I’m impressed by how much you’ve evolved. Soon we won’t have to worry about anything.” Winston blushed a deep shade of red.

“T-thanks.”
